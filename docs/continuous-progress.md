# Continuous development checkpoint

Goal active: follow `prompts/grow-continuously.md` until the user stops it.
Previous goal turns made concrete progress; no blocking condition exists.

## Current source and publishing

Repository `/home/gsc/code/glassmind`, branch `harness`.
Merged PR #4 (conversation calculations), main merge `f83aefc`;
merged PR #5 (exact percentages/MathQA), main merge `d607271`.
Merged PR #6 (syntax repairs and acronym guard), merge `138676e`,
evaluated PR head `ed81553`. New local commits awaiting full coding dev:
`ea52c58` (type renaming), `797ba62` (story conversation), `ebd9817`
(fixed byte probability scorer). All three workers completed; no model
workers remain active. Reporting/checkpoint changes follow these commits.
Do not push worker candidates until their affected full dev evidence passes.

The latest complete benchmark records are in `docs/results/tracks.jsonl`;
`docs/results/tracks.html` is regenerated at each batch. Historical reports
retain their original scope and source revisions.

## Completed and verified this continuous run

- Main `talk` calculates exact quantities while preserving memory and session
  behavior. Mixed synthetic conversation 18/27→27/27 with/without intent
  model; memory41/41; full3116 synthetic quantities through talk retain
  3056 correct,60 unsupported,0 wrong, including762 expected refusals.
  Source `b4b1b3f`, report `docs/talk-quantities.md`.
- Percentages: source `e3eb10f`; MathQA official dev4475 under the custom
  exact-numeric/no-choice metric improves5/4469/1→14/4458/3 right/refused/wrong.
  The two extra scored errors compare exact arithmetic with rounded choices;
  counts remain unchanged by adjudication. A separate300-case Fraction audit
  passes. All3116 synthetic status/value/unit outputs unchanged. Gold-option
  normalization cannot handle1229 rows; they stay in the denominator. No test
  downloaded. Details `tools/quantities/HANDOFF.md`.
- Coding: source `75e3269`; full765 rustbench dev at unchanged `f79e71a`
  improves160/602/3→163/599/3. Exactly three refusal→pass transitions for
  `fix-tests/steps-moving-average`, one per style; all other762 outcomes
  unchanged. `docs/results/coding-syntax-repairs.json` records binary/result
  hashes. Coordinator extended the worker AST guards to protect test-only
  locals, expressions, arms, fields and enums. Seven focused tests pass.
  Full evaluation session52107 is COMPLETE; do not restart or keep polling it.
- Facts: source `c9ed6ed`; unchanged500-entity index/frozen model. Full2821
  dev256/2526/39→256/2545/20, all correct answers retained, no new claims.
  Sample12/186/2→12/188/0. Train diagnostics remove154 wrong claims without
  losing a right answer or adding a claim. Rejecting acronym casing keeps
  the original ambiguity and never exposes another candidate. First filter
  design created new train errors and was rejected. Five focused tests pass;
  coordinator independently reproduced final full dev. Reports in
  `tools/facts/continuous/`.

Workspace fmt, all-target clippy, release build and strict4/4 fixture smoke
pass after integrating coding and facts. No held-out evaluation has been run
in this continuous batch; none of its items was inspected.

## Current batch and one active evaluation

WORK = `/home/gsc/.cache/glassmind/continuous-20261010`.

- **Type renaming**: `ea52c58`, conservative explicit module/import resolution
  for struct/enum names; ambiguous bindings, unexpanded macros and unknown
  source files refuse. Coordinator reproduced all9 local cases, including
  exact intended source, same runtime output for3 positives, and6 refusal/
  rollback cases. World-rust tests10/10. Integrated evidence is
  `docs/results/coding-edits-integrated.json`.
- **Story conversation**: `797ba62`, bounded512-assertion journal with legacy
  session compatibility and explicit prediction labels. Coordinator found
  bare ambiguous corrections could preserve stale story state; fixed routing
  only when story context exists. The first coordinator fix changed a
  memory-only clarification; rejected and narrowed. Five CLI tests pass.
  Final integrated47/47 mixed checks with/without intent model,41/41 memory,
  27/27 calculations with/without model, fullbAbI3966/18/3 of3987 and quantities
  3056/60/0 of3116 (including762 expected refusals). Final binarySHA
  `d504e39cabe4df6516f83c3493bb485bbbd0a3af6084419c1131ecd31ef68093`.
  Reports in `docs/talk-stories-evidence/integrated/`; all those checks complete.
- **Reading**: `ebd9817`, fixed non-generating byte6-gram trained only on
  BabyLM2025 train10M. Coordinator full1340/120 evaluations exactly reproduce
  worker reports; two probability/persistence tests pass. Grammar unigram
  578good579bad183ties ->707good633bad0ties. **185 good-to-bad transitions,
  23/67 categories regress.** Reading byte-weighted BPB4.8212138605 ->
  2.1892595993; **33/120 excerpts exactly overlap training lines**, disclosed.
  Separate probability command; no semantic/independent-test claim. All
  settings/provenance/licenses/reproduction in `tools/reading/HANDOFF.md`.
  Model retained `WORK/reading-run/probability/byte6.bin` (68,861,296bytes).
- **RUNNING: full765 RustBench dev**, exec session **66778**, runnerPID1678209,
  timeout/process-group1678208. Output `WORK/coordinator/edits-full/`;
  `run.log` provides progress, `results.jsonl` only complete at finish.
  ~500cases done at this checkpoint; inspect actual status, don't restart.
  Frozen binary SHA
  `54df40227208af89128e2767bbb504e170814d9ce4b3979276b82a0133de6b1b`.
  It includes final type-renaming source plus initial story integration;
  later CLI-only correction refinement does not affect the coding command.
  Baseline is **163pass599refused3fail**, from `WORK/coordinator/coding-full/`.
  Compare every task/style transition; preserve denominator765. No held-out.

Workspace fmt/all-target clippy/release build/strict4/4 smoke pass after
all integrations. Scalar bits-per-byte report support added to
`tools/track-report.py`, including separate plot scale, finite-value checks,
explicit tie counts and model metadata. Rate/scalar/invalid-input checks
pass; render is current. No cargo job should be started uncapped.

All storychat/edits/reading workers used GPT-6 Astra fast through ChatGPT;
scopes inactive and temporary auth symlinks removed. Dirty worktrees retained
until final evidence/cleanup; original story submission differs from the
coordinator corrections. Do not restart workers or duplicate their output.
Their `NAME-run/{events.jsonl,summary.txt}` retain completed evidence.

## Completed worker cleanup and retained evidence

Coding, quantities and facts scopes ended; their temporary auth symlinks
were removed and worktrees removed. All quantity/facts files were verified
against integrated files before removal. Original coding submission is
archived in `WORK/coding-run/submitted` because coordinator guards differ.
Their logs, targets, development outputs and data remain in `*-run/`.
Known completed worker tokens:29,566,822 including cached input; parent and
unfinished worker usage excluded. Update `docs/results/worker-usage.json`
once per newly completed worker, without double-counting.

Frozen coding binary and full result: `WORK/coordinator/coding-full/`.
Before-results: `~/.cache/glassmind/grow-fast-20261010/keep-going-candidate/rustbench-dev/`.
Facts raw before/after train/dev predictions: `WORK/facts-run/tmp/`.
MathQA and PyArrow: `WORK/quantities-run/tmp/{mathqa,quantities-deps}`.
Do not delete retained data/models under `~/.cache/glassmind/{data,models}`.
The old improvement loop remains STOPPED; preserve its dirty checkout/state.

## Immediate next actions

1. Poll exec66778 / inspect full coding result once done; no other job remains
   active. Compare against163/599/3 and record exact outcome transitions and
   hashes in a new report. Do not inspect hidden tests or generators.
2. Update README/scoreboard/type-rename report with full coding result. Commit
   current reporting changes. Publish the verified batch as nextPR (#7), wait
   for CI and merge with actual headSHA. PR6 already merged; no merge retry.
3. Preserve worker evidence before removing worktrees. Baseline story refusal
   lists were summarized in git; full reports still in storychat worktree.
4. Next useful experiments: expand grounded real dialogue beyond one service;
   improve facts coverage using training-derived entities (existing index is
   validation-seeded, never call it openworld); revisit independent reading
   evaluation with a preregistered new dev split to avoid overlap. Keep parser
   coverage, probability, synthetic and scoped metrics distinct. Start a
   bounded hypothesis and keep the goal active after this batch.
